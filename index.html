<p>I first got into Edinburgh after a few days of snow, and, while most of it had melted, there was still a light dusting on some of the homes I passed while on the bus to the airport. I had a feeling that the trip would be magical, and it did not disappoint...  </div>

    <div class ="textybox"><h4>Mission Statement</h4>
    <p>We are a team of former college study abroad students who just can't stop sharing our stories with our peers. It is our goal to, first and foremost, inspire current students to look into studying abroad themselves. If we are successful, we hope, with the articles on this site, educate students in the subjects of safety and financial responsibility while abroad.
    We think these two subjects are especially pertinent to the study abroad experience, as they ensure a student's wellbeing while not restricting the fun. It is our imperative to educate prospective study abroad students on the principles of frugality, awareness, and efficiency to make sure that their trip abroad does not result in financial, mental, or physical ruin. On this blog, we have compiled
    a few articles detailing our personal experiences while studying abroad. We discuss what we did in certain countries and interesting cultural topics. In addition, we will offer tidbits of advice as well as give unsolicited reviews
    of certain products that helped us in our journeys. We may also review certain websites or services that we found helpful or otherwise. None of the reviews shown on this website are sponsored, for monetary gain or any other reason. We simply want
    the students browsing this blog to have an unbiased account on certain things that they may consider. Overall, our goal is to encourage and inspire safe, albeit fun and exciting, study abroad trips
    for prospective students. Not to mention, talking about study abroad is just fun and nostalgic! If you have any questions, feel free to follow the "Contact" link at the top of the site or visit us on
    social media and drop us a comment, and we will be sure to get back to you! Enjoy your trip abroad!
