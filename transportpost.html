 <p class="bloggy">You might think you know public transportation. If you live in a city with subways and buses, you might think you've got it down pat. But in Europe, depending on the location, it can be very different. One of the things that caused the most trouble on my trips around Europe was transportation, especially in Italy. Italy is known for having an outstanding train system, so I was confident in it. Too confident. One misunderstanding on an Italian train site derailed (pun intended) my entire plan to get back to the airport in Bergamo. I booked tickets to get straight to the airport. But there was only one problem: there was no train that went to the airport. But I had no idea, as the airport's website said that there was a train that stopped there, and my ticket said my destination was the airport. After a conversation with a very confused train attendant, I wound up having to get off the train in a town just outside of Bergamo, and I had to walk for two hours on freeways to the airport. I depended on Google Maps, which tried to send me through an airstrip, which only made it worse. Oh, and, in Rome just a few days earlier, I had broken my ankle. I didn't know this, but the fact that, as I was walking, my ankle kept giving out should have told me. All of this could have been avoided if I had done intensive research on how the train system works. For the most part, buses are very straightforward, as are subways. But being careful and doing loads of research before you book anything or step on that bus or subway car can save you a lot of tears and money. My misadventure in rural Italy made me miss my flight and cost me €100 to book a new flight, and I had to sit in the airport (which had very limited Wifi) for 10 hours. My advice also goes for booking flights with European airlines. It is very, very enticing to book a flight with Ryanair, which has some of the lowest flight prices. A trip to Paris would only have cost me €30 for a round trip ticket. However, while these prices seem great at face value, there are many other factors to consider before booking that flight. Most flights via Ryanair only service tiny airports that are actually pretty far from your destination. As such, these airports usually don't have many options as far as transportation to the city you actually need to get to goes. You may end up shelling out for an expensive Uber ride, if Uber is available (in rural Italy, for example, it is not). You might end up spending hours in the airport just trying to figure out how to get out, or realize that the subway line that services the tiny airport ends as soon as you show up, or that the bus system also ends at an unreasonable time. You might end up spending more just to get to your destination than it would have been if you had taken the nicer airline to the bigger airport with ample transport options. While researching transportation options might seem like a tedious burden, it's much better to have a solid plan you can be confident in than crying your eyes out because you just spent €60 on an Uber when you could have spent that extra €20 to get a plane ticket to a bigger, closer airport.
