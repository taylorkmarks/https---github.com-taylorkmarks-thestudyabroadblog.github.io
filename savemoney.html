 <p class="bloggy">Let's be real: when you study abroad, you probably won't die. But your bank account might, hence the the tombstone picture. One of the only downsides to studying abroad is the toll it takes on your bank account. Here are some quick tips to help you maintain some financial responsibility during your travels!
<br>
<br>
<b>Start Saving Before You Leave</b>
<br>
<br>
A simple, and possibly obvious, first step. Saving money ahead of time and having as much on you as possible will minimize the damage you will unavoidably do on your bank account. Cut back on frivolous spending, get a job, ask your family and friends for money, start a GoFundMe, panhandle on the streets- do what you must to save up. Trust me, you will wish you had saved that $5 you spent on your Frappuccino when you see a cute souvenir that you can't afford.
<br>
<br>
<b>Cook for Yourself</b>
<br>
<br>
You might think, "Why cook when I can sample worldy cuisines?" While eating out ocassionally won't bust your budget, it's important to realize that cooking for yourself doesn't have to deprive you of your host country's delicacies. It's a much cheaper alternative, as you will have leftovers to cherish for days!

<p class="bloggy">
<b>Stay in Hostels when Traveling</b>
<br>
<br>
Don't stay in costly hotels. Stay in hostels, because one letter can make a world of difference. In hostels, you get many of the same amenities as a hotel, but you share a room with other guests. Most hostels have rooms of 6 or 8, and are usually separated by gender. Bathrooms are usually shared, you might have to sleep in a bunk bed, and you probably have to store your personal belongings in a little cage-like box under your bed, but, all-in-all, the money saved makes it absolutely worth it. Just make sure the hostel is reputable.
<br>
<br>
<b>Use Cheap Airlines...</b>
<br>
<br>
Airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet offer no-frills flight service, meaning your costs are significantly reduced. You can fly from Dubin to Paris for as little as 30 Euro, roundtrip! 
<br>
<br>
<b>...BUT Research the Costs of Getting To and From the Airport</b>
<br>
<br>
As I discuss in <a href="transportpost.html">this post</a>, finding transportation to and from the airports served by cheap airlines can negate the cost of your ticket. Do research beforehand and save yourself a couple of bucks.
<br>
<br>

<b>Have a friend hold you accountable</b>
<br>
<br>
Shame is one of the world's best deterrents. Getting a friend to shame you out of spending too much of your precious money will work wonders.
<br>
<br>
Following these simple tips could save you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. Your bank account will thank you.
