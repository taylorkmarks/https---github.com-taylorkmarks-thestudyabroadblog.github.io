        <h3>Exploring Edinburgh</h3>
        <h5>Taylor Marks | December 8, 2017 | 1:25pm | Edinburgh, Scotland</h5>
        <p>I first got into Edinburgh after a few days of snow, and, while most of it had melted, there was still a light dusting on some of the homes I passed while on the bus to the airport. I had a feeling that the trip would be magical, and it did not disappoint. Edinburgh is a gothic city with a dark, intricate skyline but with the warmest and kindest people.

Although traversing the city was a bit of a struggle for someone who had unknowingly broken her ankle, it was still marvelous to see all of the closes, many of which were decorated for Christmas. My first point of interest was Edinburgh Castle, which rests atop a hill. It was incredible, and not just because bagpipe rock music played in nearly every exhibit. Outside, on the famous Royal Mile that led up to the Castle, men in kilts played bagpipes and shops sold the softest scarves I'd ever touched...

        <h3>Galway Girl</h3>
        <h5>Taylor Marks | August 29, 2017 | 2:35pm | Galway, Ireland</h5>
        <p>When I hopped off the plane at Dublin I expected my destination to be every bit as incredible as I had expected. And Galway surely was magnificent, in the way only a seaside Irish town could be. The faint hint of seawater in the wind, the seagulls on the rooftops, the drunken cheers in the night- it was like living in another world. However, Galway was facing a housing crisis and, as such, this was all experienced while living in a hostel. Yes, for four months I lived in a postage stamp with three other girls, crammed into bunk beds, groceries scattered about the floor, bathroom almost always occupied. But dorm living at home had prepared me for this, and we made it out okay. We even managed, by some miracle, to all stay friends afterward. Galway was too good to tear us apart. I will always miss Shop Street, with its bustling souvenir shops, tattoo parlors (including the one where I got my tattoo), and tiny restaurants...
